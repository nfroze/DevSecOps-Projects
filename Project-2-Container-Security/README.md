# 🐳 Project 2: Container Security (Docker, ECS)

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **secure containerized environments** using **Docker** and **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**. It focuses on best practices for **container security**, **image vulnerability scanning**, and **automated deployment** to **ECS** using a Docker container.

By automating the entire pipeline, from **Docker image creation** to **ECS deployment**, this project showcases the importance of securing containerized applications and ensuring **efficient, automated deployments** with minimal manual intervention.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Docker** – Containerization platform to build and run applications in containers.
- **Amazon ECS** – Managed service for running containers at scale.
- **Trivy** – Image vulnerability scanning tool to ensure security best practices are followed.
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline to automate building, scanning, and deploying Docker images.

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Docker image creation** using best security practices.  
✅ **Vulnerability scanning** with **Trivy** to detect high and critical vulnerabilities.  
✅ **Automated ECS deployment** to ensure secure, up-to-date containerized applications.  
✅ **Automated CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions to push images to Docker Hub and update ECS.

## 🔒 Security Considerations  
- **Use of trusted base images** to minimize vulnerabilities.  
- **Regular image scanning** using **Trivy** to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.  
- **Automated ECS deployment** ensures that only the most secure version of the application is deployed.  
- **Least privilege IAM roles** are used to ensure ECS tasks and services have the minimum permissions necessary to function.

## 📝 Workflow
The workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Build Docker image** – Using the Dockerfile, the image is built locally with the contents of the `app` folder.
2. **Scan Docker image** – The image is scanned using **Trivy** to detect high and critical vulnerabilities.
3. **Push Docker image to Docker Hub** – After successful scanning, the Docker image is pushed to **Docker Hub** for remote storage.
4. **Deploy to ECS** – The image is pulled from Docker Hub and deployed to an **ECS cluster**, updating the existing ECS service with the new image.

## 🔄 ECS Update Process
After the Docker image is updated on Docker Hub:
- A new **ECS task** is created with the latest image.
- The old task is stopped once the new task starts running, ensuring a **seamless deployment process** without downtime.

This ensures that the **ECS service** is always running the most secure version of the containerized application, minimizing the risk of running vulnerable or outdated images.

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline
The **CI/CD pipeline** is fully automated using **GitHub Actions** to ensure secure and efficient deployments. The pipeline includes:

- **Building** the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
- **Scanning** the image for security vulnerabilities using **Trivy**.
- **Pushing** the image to **Docker Hub** after successful scanning.
- **Updating ECS** with the new image using **AWS CLI**.

### Pipeline Overview:
1. **`build-scan-push`**: This job builds the Docker image, scans it for vulnerabilities using **Trivy**, and pushes the image to **Docker Hub** if no vulnerabilities are found.
2. **`ecs-update`**: Once the image is pushed, this job updates the ECS service with the new image, ensuring that the ECS service runs the most secure version of the container.

## 🏆 Benefits of This Project to Companies
### **Automated Security Checks with Trivy**:
- **Early detection of vulnerabilities**: **Trivy** scans Docker images before deployment to detect any **high or critical vulnerabilities**, ensuring that no insecure or outdated images are deployed to production.
- **Automated scanning**: The integration of **Trivy** with the CI/CD pipeline ensures that every build undergoes vulnerability checks, minimizing manual errors and increasing security.

### **Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
- **Streamlined workflow**: The entire build, scan, and deploy process is automated using **GitHub Actions**, which eliminates the need for manual intervention and speeds up the deployment cycle.
- **Consistency and repeatability**: With the pipeline in place, the same steps are followed for each deployment, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of human error.

### **Secure and Scalable Deployment with ECS**:
- **ECS** provides a **managed service** for running containers at scale, ensuring **high availability** and **fault tolerance** for your application.
- The pipeline **automates deployment** to ECS, ensuring that the latest secure version of the application is always running without any manual effort.

### **Least Privilege IAM Roles**:
- The use of **least privilege IAM roles** ensures that ECS tasks and services only have the **minimum permissions** necessary to operate. This reduces the potential impact of any security incidents by limiting the scope of what compromised services can access.

### **Production-Ready Deployment**:
- This project demonstrates a **production-ready pipeline** that automates key security tasks like vulnerability scanning, image pushing, and ECS updates. The **minimal human intervention** required makes it ideal for environments where **uptime** and **security** are critical.

## 📋 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **containerized applications** can be securely built, scanned, and deployed using **Docker**, **ECS**, and **GitHub Actions**. By incorporating **automated vulnerability scanning**, **CI/CD automation**, and **least privilege IAM roles**, the deployment process is not only secure but also efficient, repeatable, and scalable.

Implementing this solution helps **companies automate their deployment pipelines**, ensure that **secure images** are always deployed to **ECS**, and achieve **faster and more reliable deployments** with minimal manual intervention.
