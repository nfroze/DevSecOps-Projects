# 🐳 Project 2: Container Security (Docker)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on securing containerized environments using **Docker**. The goal is to demonstrate best practices for **container security**, particularly through **image vulnerability scanning** and **secure image distribution**.

In this demo, the focus is on building a **secure Docker image**, scanning it for vulnerabilities, and pushing it to a container registry.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Docker** – Containerization platform
- **Trivy** – Image vulnerability scanning tool
- **Docker Hub** – Container registry for storing the image

## 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ **Docker image creation** using best practices  
- ✅ **Image vulnerability scanning** using **Trivy**  
- ✅ **Docker Hub integration** for pushing images securely

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Only trusted base images** are used to minimize vulnerabilities  
- **Regular image scanning** with **Trivy** to detect high and critical vulnerabilities  
- **Docker Hub** used to store and distribute the image securely

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Created** the Docker image with a secure base.
2. **Scanned** the image for vulnerabilities using **Trivy**.
3. **Pushed** the image to **Docker Hub** if no vulnerabilities were found.

## 🔗 Next Steps with the Scanned Image
After scanning the Docker image for vulnerabilities and pushing it to **Docker Hub**, the image is now ready to be safely deployed to cloud container services like **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)** or **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**.
