Project 5: Threat Modeling & Incident Response
Project Overview
Objective: Develop a Threat Model and simulate Incident Response workflows.
Key Focus: Identify security risks, develop mitigation strategies, and create security playbooks.
Technologies Used
Draw.io (Threat Modeling Diagrams), MITRE ATT&CK, SIEM (Splunk, ELK)
Key Features
✔️ Threat model diagrams for attack scenarios
✔️ Incident response simulation for security breaches
✔️ Integration with SIEM for log analysis and alerting

Security Considerations
🔹 Threat models map out attack vectors
🔹 Incident response workflows improve security readiness
🔹 SIEM integration ensures real-time monitoring
