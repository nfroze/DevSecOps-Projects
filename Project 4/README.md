# 🔥 Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves **threat modeling** and **incident response simulations**, demonstrating how to proactively identify security risks before deployment and respond to threats effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** – Cyber threat classification  
- **STRIDE Threat Modeling** – Security risk assessment  
- **SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)** – Log monitoring  
- **AWS GuardDuty / Azure Sentinel** – Threat detection & response  

## 🔑 Key Features
✅ **STRIDE threat modeling** for secure architecture design  
✅ **Simulated security incidents** with response playbooks  
✅ **SIEM integration** for real-time threat monitoring  
✅ **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** to known attack techniques  

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Proactive threat detection** using real-world attack scenarios  
- **Incident response workflow** to mitigate security breaches  
- **Security automation** to reduce response time to attacks
