# 📌 Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **secure infrastructure deployment** using **Terraform** in **AWS**. The focus is on best practices for **S3 bucket security**, **IAM policies**, and **IaC scanning** to ensure the infrastructure is secure and follows industry best practices.

By automating the entire infrastructure deployment process with **Terraform**, this project highlights the benefits of using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **automated security checks** to ensure a **secure, repeatable, and auditable deployment** process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code to define and provision infrastructure.
- **AWS** (S3, IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty) – Cloud services to create and manage resources.
- **Checkov** – IaC security scanning tool to ensure Terraform code follows security best practices.
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment and validation of the infrastructure.

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Secure S3 bucket policies** (encryption, versioning, and access control).  
✅ **Least privilege IAM policies** ensuring groups have only the permissions required for their roles (admins, developers, devsecops-engineers).  
✅ **IaC scanning** with **Checkov** to identify potential misconfigurations and security risks.  
✅ **Automated infrastructure deployment** using GitHub Actions to apply Terraform configurations securely.

## 🔒 Security Considerations  
- **IAM policies** strictly follow the **least privilege** principle by ensuring that each user group has only the minimum permissions needed.
- **S3 state file** is secured using **encryption** and **versioning**, ensuring **data integrity** and **confidentiality**.  
- **Public access to S3 bucket** is **blocked** to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Automated IaC scanning** (via Checkov) ensures security misconfigurations are caught early before deployment.

## 📝 Workflow
The workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Write Terraform Code** – Define the AWS resources (S3, IAM, etc.) in `main.tf` with best practices for security and least privilege.
2. **IaC Security Scanning** – Use **Checkov** to scan the Terraform code for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
3. **Deploy Infrastructure** – Using **GitHub Actions**, the Terraform code is applied to create resources in AWS.

## 🔄 Deployment Process
After the Terraform plan is validated, the infrastructure is deployed to AWS:
- **S3 buckets** are created with secure policies (versioning and encryption enabled).
- **IAM user groups** are configured with least privilege policies for **admins**, **developers**, and **devsecops engineers**.
- **Checkov** runs in the pipeline to ensure no insecure configurations are applied.

This ensures that the **AWS environment** is set up securely with proper access control and compliance.

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline
The **CI/CD pipeline** is fully automated using **GitHub Actions** to ensure secure and efficient infrastructure provisioning. The pipeline includes:

- **Running Checkov** to scan the Terraform code for security issues.
- **Validating the Terraform plan** to check for any misconfigurations.
- **Applying the Terraform code** to deploy infrastructure on AWS once the plan is validated.

### Pipeline Overview:
1. **`scan`**: This job uses **Checkov** to scan the Terraform code for potential security risks before applying it.
2. **`apply`**: After validation, this job automatically applies the Terraform code to deploy resources to AWS.

## 🏆 Benefits of This Project to Companies
### **IaC with Terraform**:
- **Consistent Infrastructure**: With **Terraform**, infrastructure is **automatically provisioned** and can be versioned to ensure **repeatability** and **consistency** across different environments.
- **Auditability**: All infrastructure changes are **version-controlled**, enabling full **audit trails** of what was deployed and when.
- **Scalability**: Terraform makes it easy to scale resources by simply updating the code and reapplying it, without needing manual intervention.

### **Automated IaC Security Scanning with Checkov**:
- **Early detection of misconfigurations**: **Checkov** automatically scans the **Terraform code** to detect potential security issues or misconfigurations before deploying infrastructure. This prevents security vulnerabilities from making it into production.
- **Continuous monitoring**: **Checkov** can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that every change is validated against security best practices.

### **Secure Infrastructure with Least Privilege IAM Roles**:
- **Least privilege access**: **IAM roles** are configured to follow the **least privilege** principle, ensuring that each user group (admins, developers, devsecops) has only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- This reduces the potential attack surface by preventing overly permissive access.

### **S3 Bucket Security**:
- **Versioning and encryption** are enabled for the **S3 state file** bucket, ensuring that infrastructure state files are **protected** and **recoverable** in case of accidental deletions or overwrites.

## 📋 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** can be used to **securely deploy** and **manage** infrastructure in AWS. By following **security best practices**, such as **least privilege IAM roles**, **secure S3 bucket configurations**, and **IaC scanning**, we ensure that the infrastructure is **both secure** and **compliant** with industry standards.

The integration of **Checkov** for **automated IaC security scanning** ensures that the infrastructure code is always validated for security risks before it is deployed. With the **CI/CD pipeline** automated via **GitHub Actions**, this setup ensures **consistent, repeatable, and secure deployments**.

### Final Thoughts:
This **Project 1** showcases the importance of using **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) to automate the **secure deployment** of resources. The use of **Terraform**, combined with **IaC scanning** (via **Checkov**) and **least privilege IAM roles**, ensures that the infrastructure is not only functional but also **secure**, **scalable**, and **efficient**.

Implementing this solution helps companies improve their **security posture**, ensure **consistent infrastructure provisioning**, and make the deployment process **more reliable** and **automated**, reducing manual errors and enabling faster delivery of secure environments.
