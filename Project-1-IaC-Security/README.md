📌 Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates secure infrastructure deployment using Terraform in AWS. It focuses on best practices for S3 bucket security, IAM policies, and IaC scanning.

🛠 Technologies Used
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code
AWS (S3, IAM) – Cloud infrastructure
Checkov – IaC security scanning
🔹 Key Features
✅ Secure S3 bucket policies (encryption, versioning, access control)
✅ IAM least privilege enforcement
✅ Checkov scan for Terraform security misconfigurations

🔐 Security Considerations
🔹 IAM policies follow least privilege
🔹 S3 buckets enforce encryption & access controls
🔹 Checkov scan integrated to flag misconfigurations
