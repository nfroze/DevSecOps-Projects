# 📌 Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates secure infrastructure deployment using **Terraform** in **AWS**. The focus is on enforcing **least privilege IAM policies** and integrating **automated IaC security scanning** with Checkov to ensure that security best practices are followed throughout the deployment process.

By automating infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and continuously scanning the code for security issues, this project highlights how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can produce a **secure, repeatable, and auditable** environment for AWS deployments.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Terraform** – Defines and provisions AWS resources.
- **AWS** (IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty) – Provides the cloud infrastructure and security services.
- **Checkov** – An IaC security scanning tool that validates Terraform code against industry best practices.
- **GitHub Actions** – Automates the CI/CD pipeline for deployment and validation.

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Least Privilege IAM Policies**:  
   - IAM groups are defined for different roles (admins, developers, and devsecops engineers) using AWS-managed policies that enforce the principle of least privilege.

✅ **Automated IaC Security Scanning**:  
   - Checkov scans the Terraform code for misconfigurations and potential security issues before deployment, ensuring that only secure configurations are applied.

✅ **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**:  
   - A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions automates the Terraform plan and apply processes, resulting in secure and consistent AWS resource deployments.

✅ **Remote State Management**:  
   - The Terraform state file is stored in an externally managed S3 backend. The remote state is automatically maintained and updated by Terraform—via our CI/CD pipeline—ensuring a single, consistent source of truth for the entire infrastructure.

## 🔒 Security Considerations  
- **IAM Policies**:  
  - The project uses AWS-managed policies to ensure that each IAM role has only the permissions required for its tasks, thereby reducing the potential attack surface.

- **Remote State Management**:  
  - The S3 backend for Terraform state is managed externally. This separation ensures that the state file, which is automatically updated by Terraform as part of the CI/CD pipeline, remains a secure and centralized source of truth for the infrastructure.

- **IaC Scanning**:  
  - Automated scanning via Checkov catches security misconfigurations early in the development process, ensuring that only secure configurations are deployed.

## 📝 Workflow  
The project workflow includes:

1. **Write Terraform Code**:  
   - Define AWS resources (primarily IAM configurations) in `main.tf` using best practices.
2. **IaC Security Scanning**:  
   - Use Checkov to scan the Terraform code for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:  
   - Use GitHub Actions to automatically plan and apply Terraform configurations, deploying resources securely to AWS.

## 🔄 Deployment Process  
After the Terraform plan is validated:
- The CI/CD pipeline deploys IAM configurations to AWS.
- The pre-configured S3 backend (managed externally) is used exclusively for storing the Terraform state file, which is automatically maintained and updated.
- Checkov runs within the pipeline to ensure that only secure configurations are deployed.

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline  
The CI/CD pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions and includes:

- **Scanning**: Running Checkov to detect any security issues in the Terraform code.
- **Planning**: Validating the Terraform plan to check for misconfigurations.
- **Applying**: Automatically deploying the Terraform configuration to AWS upon successful validation.

### Pipeline Overview:
1. **`scan`**: Checkov scans the Terraform code for security risks before any changes are applied.
2. **`apply`**: Once the plan is validated, Terraform applies the configuration to deploy resources to AWS.

## 🏆 Benefits of This Project to Companies  
### **IaC with Terraform**:
- **Consistent Infrastructure**:  
  - Infrastructure is automatically provisioned and versioned, ensuring repeatability and consistency.
- **Auditability**:  
  - All changes are version-controlled, providing a complete audit trail of what was deployed and when.
- **Scalability**:  
  - Infrastructure can be easily updated by modifying the code and reapplying it, reducing manual intervention.

### **Automated IaC Security Scanning with Checkov**:
- **Early Detection**:  
  - Security misconfigurations are identified early in the development cycle, preventing vulnerabilities from reaching production.
- **Continuous Monitoring**:  
  - Integrating Checkov into the CI/CD pipeline ensures that every change adheres to security best practices.

### **Secure Infrastructure with Least Privilege IAM Roles**:
- **Reduced Attack Surface**:  
  - Each role (admins, developers, devsecops) is granted only the minimum permissions required, minimizing security risks.

### **Remote State Management**:
- **Centralized State**:  
  - By using an externally managed S3 backend for Terraform state, the environment maintains a single, automatically updated source of truth that supports safe, concurrent collaboration—an essential feature for production deployments.

## 📋 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform** can be used to **securely deploy** and **manage** AWS infrastructure. By focusing on **least privilege IAM roles** and integrating **automated security scanning** with Checkov—along with robust remote state management—the solution achieves a secure, repeatable, and auditable deployment process that adheres to industry best practices.

### Final Thoughts  
Project 1 showcases the importance of using IaC to automate secure infrastructure deployments. By combining Terraform, Checkov, and least privilege IAM roles—with remote state management handled via an externally managed S3 backend—the solution improves security posture, ensures consistent provisioning, and enables faster, more reliable deployments.
