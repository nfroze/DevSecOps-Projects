# 📌 Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **secure infrastructure deployment** using **Terraform** in **AWS**. The goal is to apply **security best practices** to AWS services, particularly **IAM** (Identity and Access Management), **S3**, and **KMS** (Key Management Service). The focus is to automate the provisioning and securing of resources with an emphasis on **least privilege** IAM roles and policies, along with **IaC scanning** for vulnerability detection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code for defining and provisioning infrastructure.
- **AWS** (IAM, S3, KMS) – Cloud services to create and manage resources.
- **Checkov** – Infrastructure as Code security scanner to ensure Terraform scripts follow best security practices.
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline to automate the provisioning and validation of the infrastructure.

## 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **Secure S3 bucket policies** (encryption, versioning, and access control).  
✅ **Least privilege IAM policies** ensuring groups have only the permissions required for their roles (admins, developers, devsecops-engineers).  
✅ **Checkov security scan** integrated to flag any misconfigurations in Terraform code.  
✅ **Automated infrastructure deployment** using GitHub Actions to apply Terraform configurations securely.  

## 🔒 Security Considerations  
- **IAM policies** strictly follow the **least privilege** principle by ensuring that each user group has only the minimum permissions needed.
- **S3 state file** is secured using **encryption** and **versioning**, ensuring **data integrity** and **confidentiality**.  
- **Public access to S3 bucket** is **blocked** to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Automated IaC scanning** (via Checkov) ensures security misconfigurations are caught early.

## 🔄 Benefits of Using IaC and Automation in This Project:
### **IaC with Terraform**:  
- **Consistent Infrastructure**: Terraform ensures infrastructure is **provisioned consistently** across different environments without manual errors.  
- **Auditability and Versioning**: **Version-controlled Terraform code** allows tracking of infrastructure changes and rollback if necessary.  
- **Scalability**: As the infrastructure grows, Terraform allows scaling by updating the code and reapplying configurations.

### **IaC Scanning and Security Best Practices**:  
- **Early Detection of Misconfigurations**: Integrating **Checkov** into the CI/CD pipeline allows for catching misconfigurations and security risks before deployment.  
- **Security Automation**: **Automated security checks** in Terraform ensure that the environment is always secure and compliant.

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration:
The infrastructure is **automated** using **GitHub Actions**, which:
1. **Checks Terraform code** for any issues using **Checkov**.
2. **Deploys** the infrastructure to AWS using **Terraform apply**.

## 📋 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the power of **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) using **Terraform** for **automated, secure, and auditable infrastructure deployments**. By following best practices for **security**, **version control**, and **automated scanning**, we ensure that the infrastructure is **secure**, **compliant**, and **resilient**.
