Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
Project Overview
Objective: Secure infrastructure deployment using Terraform, following best practices.
Key Focus: Secure S3 buckets, enforce IAM policies, and scan IaC code for vulnerabilities.
Technologies Used
Terraform, AWS (S3, IAM)
Checkov (IaC scanning)
Key Features
✔️ Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure
✔️ Secure S3 bucket policies (encryption, versioning, access control)
✔️ IAM least privilege enforcement
✔️ Checkov scan for Terraform security misconfigurations

Security Considerations
🔹 IAM policies follow least privilege
🔹 S3 buckets enforce encryption & access controls
🔹 Checkov scan integrated to flag misconfigurations
