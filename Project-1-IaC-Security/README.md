📌 Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates secure infrastructure deployment using Terraform in AWS. It focuses on best practices for S3 bucket security, IAM policies, and IaC scanning.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code
AWS (S3, IAM) – Cloud Infrastructure
Checkov – IaC Security Scanning
✨ Key Features
✅ Secure S3 bucket policies (encryption, versioning, access control)
✅ IAM least privilege enforcement
✅ Checkov scan for Terraform security misconfigurations

🔐 Security Considerations
IAM policies follow least privilege principle
S3 buckets enforce encryption & access controls
Checkov scan integrated to flag misconfigurations
