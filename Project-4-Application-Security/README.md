# 🛡️ Project 4: Application Security & Penetration Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on securing web applications through **penetration testing (pentesting)**, **DAST scanning**, and **OWASP Top 10** vulnerability mitigation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Burp Suite** – Manual web application pentesting  
- **OWASP ZAP** – Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)  
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework  
- **Kali Linux** – Ethical hacking tools  

## 🔑 Key Features
✅ **DAST scanning** to detect real-world application vulnerabilities  
✅ **Burp Suite testing** for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., SQLi, XSS)  
✅ **Automated OWASP ZAP scans** integrated into CI/CD pipeline  
✅ **Manual penetration testing report** with mitigation recommendations  

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Mitigation strategies** for common web security flaws  
- **Automated DAST integration** into CI/CD pipeline  
- **Ethical hacking methodologies** for secure development
