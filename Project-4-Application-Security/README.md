# ☁️ Project 4: Cloud Security (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project secures cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. It ensures **IAM hardening**, **network security**, and **threat monitoring** using cloud-native security tools.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **AWS IAM** – Identity & Access Management  
- **AWS Security Hub** – Continuous compliance monitoring  
- **AWS GuardDuty** – Threat detection  
- **Azure Security Center** – Azure workload protection  
- **Google Cloud Security Command Center** – GCP security monitoring  

## 🔑 Key Features
✅ **IAM least privilege enforcement** across cloud platforms  
✅ **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to restrict cloud access  
✅ **AWS GuardDuty threat intelligence** for anomaly detection  
✅ **Cloud security posture management (CSPM)** to ensure compliance  

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement**  
- **Regular IAM audits** to prevent privilege escalation  
- **Security logging & monitoring** to detect threats in real-time
