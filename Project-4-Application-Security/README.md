Project 4: Application Security & Penetration Testing
Project Overview
Objective: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in a web application.
Key Focus: Perform DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) and penetration testing.
Technologies Used
OWASP ZAP (DAST), Burp Suite, Metasploit, Kali Linux
Key Features
✔️ OWASP ZAP scans for web application vulnerabilities
✔️ Manual Burp Suite testing for XSS, SQL Injection
✔️ Metasploit/Kali for real-world attack simulations

Security Considerations
🔹 Identify vulnerabilities using DAST & penetration testing
🔹 Secure APIs and web application endpoints
🔹 Ensure compliance with OWASP Top 10
