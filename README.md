# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer-in-Training**, combining a background in criminology and law with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software delivery.

I’m passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from CI/CD pipelines to cloud deployments — and I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to stay ahead of modern threats.

## 🔐 DevSecOps Projects

### 🛠️ Project 1: CI/CD Pipeline Security
- Built a secure GitHub Actions workflow integrating:
  - **SAST** with Semgrep  
  - **SCA** with npm audit  
  - **Secrets scanning** with Gitleaks  
- Prevented vulnerable or misconfigured code from being merged or deployed  
- Demonstrated shift-left security and fail-fast pipeline design

### 🐳 Project 2: Image and Runtime Application Security
- Built and scanned Docker images using **Trivy**
- Pushed secure images to Docker Hub and deployed to **Amazon ECS**
- Performed **DAST** using **OWASP ZAP** on the live ECS service
- IAM roles separated by least privilege for task and execution roles

### ☁️ Project 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
- Used **Terraform** to provision secure AWS infrastructure (IAM, S3, EC2)
- Integrated **Checkov** into a two-step CI/CD pipeline (scan → deploy)
- Enforced least privilege IAM roles and secure state management via S3
- Automated misconfiguration checks during PRs to ensure secure-by-default deployments

### 🧠 Project 4: Threat Modeling & Incident Response (🚧 In Progress)
- Currently developing threat models using **STRIDE** and **data flow diagrams**
- Simulating an incident response workflow using **NIST IR guidelines**
- Will document detection, containment, and recovery strategies for common attack scenarios

## 📚 Certifications in Progress

- **CompTIA Security+**  
- **AWS Cloud Practitioner**  
- **Terraform Associate**  
- **GitHub Actions Security**  
- **AWS Certified AI Practitioner** (with AI/ML Security focus)

## 🚀 What Drives Me

Security is more than just a layer — it’s a mindset.  
I bring real-world discipline, technical curiosity, and a commitment to protecting systems just as I once protected people.
