# DevSecOps Projects

This repository contains a collection of **DevSecOps projects** designed to demonstrate my skills and competencies across key areas such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Container Security, CI/CD Pipeline Security, and more. The projects have been structured to highlight my hands-on experience with various DevSecOps tools and techniques.

## Projects

1. **Project 1: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**
   - Automating infrastructure deployment using Terraform, ensuring security best practices (e.g., secure S3 buckets, IAM policies, etc.).
   - Tools: Terraform, AWS, Checkov for IaC scanning.

2. **Project 2: Container Security (Docker, Kubernetes)**
   - Setting up secure containerized environments, including Docker image scanning and Kubernetes deployments.
   - Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Trivy for image scanning, Kube-bench.

3. **Project 3: CI/CD Pipeline Security**
   - Building secure CI/CD pipelines that integrate automated security checks (e.g., SAST, SCA, vulnerability scanning).
   - Tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, Trivy, Checkov, SonarQube.

4. **Project 4: Application Security & Penetration Testing**
   - Conducting vulnerability assessments of an application using tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.
   - Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Metasploit.

5. **Project 5: Cloud Security**
   - Ensuring security in cloud environments by applying best practices for IAM, encryption, logging, and monitoring.
   - Tools: AWS, GCP, Azure, CloudFormation, IAM.

6. **Project 6: Threat Modeling & Incident Response**
   - Developing threat models and responding to incidents with proper mitigation and security controls.
   - Tools: Threat modeling, incident response playbooks, SIEM.

## Notes

These projects are intended to showcase my DevSecOps capabilities. Each project is fully documented, and the workflows can be executed independently. Feel free to explore the individual project directories to see how each one demonstrates the implementation of security practices.
