# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]

**Former Police Constable turned DevSecOps Engineer-in-Training**, combining a background in criminology and criminal justice with hands-on experience in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and secure software development.

I’m passionate about building and securing systems the right way — from day one. I believe in shift-left security, automation, and continuous learning to keep systems resilient and trustworthy.
